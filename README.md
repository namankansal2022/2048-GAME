# 2048 Game Clone in Java (Processing + Gradle)

A full-featured clone of the classic 2048 puzzle game, developed as a platform to explore and apply concepts in **event-driven programming**, **real-time animation**, and **interactive UI design** using Java.

## 🎮 Features

- Dynamic, responsive game board with support for varying grid sizes  
- Smooth tile transitions and animations for merges and movements  
- Real-time merging logic with proper chaining and move validation  
- Interactive tile spawning via mouse clicks and hover effects  
- Keyboard input handling for gameplay  
- Restart logic and game-over detection  
- Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** — Core game logic and architecture  
- **Processing (PApplet)** — Rendering engine for graphics, animation, and input  
- **Gradle** — Dependency management and project automation in a modular structure  

## 📦 Project Structure

This project follows a modular structure using Gradle, making it easy to build, test, and extend.

## 🚀 Getting Started
